# Heterogenous-bagging-ensemble

The idea behind this project is to compare an Heterogeneous Bagging Ensemble using Neural Networks (strong learners) and the same ensemble model consisted of a Decision tree, a Logistic Regression classifier and a Support Vector Classification (SVC) classifier (weak learners) and the impact of imbalanced data on those 2 ensembles.

The Confusion Matrix and the Classification Report of the Weak learners ensemble is expected to be like:
